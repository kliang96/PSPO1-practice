			"topic": "scrum-theory",
			"difficulty": "easy",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner needs to make a decision about product priorities but lacks complete information about user needs. How should the three pillars of empirical process control guide their approach?",
			"options": [
				"Create detailed specifications first, then inspect and adapt",
				"Use transparency to share assumptions, inspect through user feedback, and adapt based on learning",
				"Wait for complete information before making any decisions",
				"Focus on inspection only to gather all possible data"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "Empirical process control uses transparency (sharing assumptions), inspection (gathering user feedback), and adaptation (learning-based changes) to manage uncertainty. This approach acknowledges incomplete information and uses empirical methods to make informed decisions.",

		{
			"id": 101,
			"topic": "scrum-theory",
			"difficulty": "easy",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner is under pressure to commit to specific delivery dates for all features. How should the five Scrum values guide their response?",
			"options": [
				"Commit to all dates to show commitment and focus",
				"Use openness to explain uncertainty, courage to resist false commitments, and focus on delivering value",
				"Respect stakeholder demands by providing the requested dates",
				"Focus solely on the current Sprint and ignore long-term planning"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "Scrum values guide the Product Owner to be open about uncertainty, show courage in resisting false commitments, and maintain focus on value delivery. Commitment in Scrum is about dedication to goals and team success, not false promises about unpredictable futures.",

		{
			"id": 102,
			"topic": "scrum-theory",
			"difficulty": "medium",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner discovers that stakeholders want detailed upfront planning and predictable delivery schedules. How should they explain the purpose of empirical process control in product development?",
			"options": [
				"Empirical process control eliminates all uncertainty in product development",
				"It manages uncertainty and complexity by making decisions based on observation and learning rather than prediction",
				"It provides more accurate predictions than traditional planning methods",
				"It allows for better control of team productivity and output"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "Empirical process control acknowledges that product development involves uncertainty and complexity that can't be fully predicted upfront. It uses observation, learning, and adaptation to make informed decisions rather than relying on detailed predictions.",

		},
		{
			"id": 103,
			"topic": "scrum-theory",
			"difficulty": "medium",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner is hesitant to share product performance metrics with stakeholders because some metrics show concerning trends. How should the Scrum value of Openness guide their decision?",
			"options": [
				"Share only positive metrics to maintain stakeholder confidence",
				"Be transparent about both positive and concerning metrics to enable informed decision-making",
				"Wait until problems are solved before sharing any metrics",
				"Focus on activity metrics rather than outcome metrics"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "Openness requires being honest about both successes and challenges. Sharing concerning metrics enables stakeholders to make informed decisions and support necessary changes. Hiding problems prevents the transparency needed for effective empirical process control.",

		{
			"id": 104,
			"topic": "scrum-theory",
			"difficulty": "medium",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner is pulled in many directions by competing stakeholder demands and struggles to maintain focus. How should the Scrum value of Focus guide their approach?",
			"options": [
				"Try to satisfy all stakeholder demands equally",
				"Focus on the Product Goal and Sprint Goal while managing stakeholder expectations",
				"Delegate stakeholder management to avoid distraction",
				"Focus only on the highest-paid stakeholders"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "Focus means concentrating on the Product Goal and Sprint Goal while managing stakeholder expectations. This requires prioritizing work that delivers value toward these goals rather than trying to satisfy all demands equally.",
			"originalTopic": "scrum-theory",
			"sourceFile": "questions/scrum-theory.json"
		},
		{
			"id": 105,
			"topic": "scrum-theory",
			"difficulty": "medium",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner realizes that a highly requested feature isn't delivering expected value, but stakeholders are resistant to change. How should the Scrum value of Courage guide their response?",
			"options": [
				"Continue with the feature to avoid conflict",
				"Have the courage to present data, challenge assumptions, and advocate for better alternatives",
				"Escalate the decision to higher management",
				"Implement the feature but document concerns for later review"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "Courage means having difficult conversations and challenging assumptions when necessary. The Product Owner should present data about the feature's performance and advocate for alternatives that would deliver better value, even if this creates short-term conflict.",

		{
			"id": 106,
			"topic": "scrum-theory",
			"difficulty": "medium",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner wants to improve transparency with stakeholders who complain they don't understand what the team is working on. What approach would best support transparency?",
			"options": [
				"Provide detailed documentation of all development activities",
				"Make the Product Backlog, Sprint Goals, and progress visible and understandable to stakeholders",
				"Schedule weekly status meetings with detailed reports",
				"Create a project dashboard with technical metrics"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "Transparency requires making work visible and understandable to those who need it. Making the Product Backlog, Sprint Goals, and progress visible enables stakeholders to understand what's being worked on and why, supporting better collaboration and decision-making.",

		{
			"id": 107,
			"topic": "scrum-theory",
			"difficulty": "hard",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner notices that Sprint Reviews aren't leading to meaningful Product Backlog changes despite stakeholder attendance. What might be wrong with their inspection and adaptation process?",
			"options": [
				"Stakeholders aren't providing enough feedback during Sprint Reviews",
				"The inspection may lack depth or the Product Owner isn't effectively adapting based on insights",
				"The Sprint Review format needs to be more formal and structured",
				"The Development Team isn't presenting the Increment properly"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "If inspection (Sprint Review) isn't leading to adaptation (Product Backlog changes), either the inspection lacks depth or the Product Owner isn't effectively translating insights into backlog changes. Meaningful inspection should reveal opportunities for improvement that drive adaptation.",
			"originalTopic": "scrum-theory",

		{
			"id": 108,
			"topic": "scrum-theory",
			"difficulty": "hard",
			"type": "multiple",
			"question": "A Product Owner works with a diverse team including junior developers, senior architects, and UX designers. How should the Scrum value of Respect guide their interactions? (Choose all that apply)",
			"options": [
				"Value everyone's perspectives and contributions regardless of experience level",
				"Respect the team's technical decisions even when they impact delivery timelines",
				"Acknowledge different working styles and communication preferences",
				"Defer all technical decisions to the most senior team member"
			],
			"correctAnswer": [0, 1, 2],
			"explanation": "Respect includes valuing diverse perspectives, respecting technical expertise that impacts delivery, and acknowledging different working styles. However, respect doesn't mean automatically deferring to seniority - it means considering all viewpoints thoughtfully.",
			"originalTopic": "scrum-theory",
			"sourceFile": "questions/scrum-theory.json"
		},
		{
			"id": 109,
			"topic": "scrum-theory",
			"difficulty": "medium",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner is tempted to inspect the team's work daily to ensure they're building the right thing. What guidance should they follow about inspection frequency?",
			"options": [
				"Inspect as frequently as possible to catch issues early",
				"Only inspect during formal Scrum events",
				"Inspect frequently enough to gather useful feedback without hindering the team's work",
				"Inspect only when stakeholders request updates"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 2,
			"explanation": "Inspection should be frequent enough to provide useful feedback but not so frequent that it becomes counterproductive. The Product Owner should balance the need for visibility with the team's need for focus and autonomy.",

		{
			"id": 110,
			"topic": "scrum-theory",
			"difficulty": "hard",
			"type": "multiple",
			"question": "A Product Owner wants to improve transparency with stakeholders who feel disconnected from development. Which approaches would best support transparency? (Choose all that apply)",
			"options": [
				"Make the Product Backlog priorities and rationale visible to stakeholders",
				"Share Sprint Goals and progress toward those goals",
				"Provide detailed individual developer productivity metrics",
				"Create clear Definition of Done criteria that stakeholders can understand"
			],
			"correctAnswer": [0, 1, 3],
			"explanation": "Transparency is supported by making priorities and rationale visible, sharing Sprint Goals and progress, and having clear standards. Individual productivity metrics don't enhance transparency about product progress and may undermine team collaboration.",
			"originalTopic": "scrum-theory",
			"sourceFile": "questions/scrum-theory.json"
		},
		{
			"id": 111,
			"topic": "scrum-theory",
			"difficulty": "hard",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner's stakeholders complain they can't see development progress between Sprint Reviews. The team delivers working software but stakeholders feel disconnected. How should the Product Owner improve transparency?",
			"options": [
				"Create detailed daily status reports for stakeholders",
				"Make Sprint progress, impediments, and completed work visible to stakeholders throughout the Sprint",
				"Schedule weekly stakeholder meetings to demonstrate progress",
				"Provide access to the team's task management system"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "Transparency requires ongoing visibility, not just periodic reporting. Making Sprint progress, impediments, and completed work visible throughout the Sprint enables stakeholders to understand progress and provide timely feedback.",
			"originalTopic": "scrum-theory",
			"sourceFile": "questions/scrum-theory.json"
		},
		{
			"id": 112,
			"topic": "scrum-theory",
			"difficulty": "hard",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "During a Sprint Review, a Product Owner realizes that completed features don't align with the Sprint Goal, despite individual backlog items being done correctly. What empirical process control issue occurred?",
			"options": [
				"The Sprint Goal wasn't clearly communicated (transparency failure)",
				"Progress toward the Sprint Goal wasn't monitored during the Sprint (inspection failure)",
				"The team didn't adjust their approach when Sprint Goal alignment became unclear (adaptation failure)",
				"All of the above"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 3,
			"explanation": "This scenario demonstrates failures in all three pillars: lack of transparency about Sprint Goal alignment, insufficient inspection of progress toward the goal during the Sprint, and failure to adapt when alignment became unclear. All three pillars must work together.",
			"originalTopic": "scrum-theory",
			"sourceFile": "questions/scrum-theory.json"
		},
		{
			"id": 113,
			"topic": "scrum-theory",
			"difficulty": "hard",
			"type": "multiple",
			"question": "A Product Owner works in a highly regulated industry where compliance requirements seem to conflict with Scrum values. How can they apply Scrum values while meeting regulatory needs? (Choose all that apply)",
			"options": [
				"Focus on delivering value within regulatory constraints rather than ignoring them",
				"Have courage to challenge unnecessary bureaucratic processes while respecting legitimate requirements",
				"Be transparent about how regulations impact delivery timelines and priorities",
				"Respect regulatory requirements while continuously seeking process improvements"
			],
			"correctAnswer": [0, 1, 2, 3],
			"explanation": "All options demonstrate proper application of Scrum values in regulated environments. Focus drives value delivery within constraints, courage enables constructive challenge of unnecessary processes, transparency reveals regulatory impacts, and respect acknowledges legitimate requirements while seeking improvement.",

		},
		{
			"id": 114,
			"topic": "scrum-theory",
			"difficulty": "hard",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner and Development Team disagree about the priority of technical debt work versus new features. The disagreement is causing tension and delaying decisions. Which Scrum value should guide resolution?",
			"options": [
				"Commitment - both sides must commit to a compromise",
				"Focus - stick to the original Product Backlog priorities",
				"Openness - discuss the underlying concerns and trade-offs transparently",
				"Respect - defer to the Development Team's technical expertise"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 2,
			"explanation": "Openness requires discussing underlying concerns and trade-offs transparently. This enables both sides to understand each other's perspectives and find solutions that address both value delivery and technical sustainability.",

			"sourceFile": "questions/scrum-theory.json"
		},
		{
			"id": 115,
			"topic": "scrum-theory",
			"difficulty": "hard",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner frequently changes priorities mid-Sprint, citing 'market adaptability' as justification. This disrupts Sprint Goals and team focus. What's the fundamental issue with this approach to adaptation?",
			"options": [
				"Market changes aren't valid reasons for adaptation in Scrum",
				"Adaptation requires prior inspection, which needs stable periods to assess results",
				"Only the Development Team should initiate adaptations during a Sprint",
				"Sprint Goals should never be changed once committed"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "Adaptation must be based on inspection of results, which requires stable periods to assess outcomes. Constant changes prevent meaningful inspection and learning. The Sprint provides stability needed for empirical process control - frequent changes undermine this foundation.",
