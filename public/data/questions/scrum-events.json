			"question": "What is the maximum time-box for a Sprint, and what determines its length?",
			"options": [
				"Two weeks maximum, determined by the Development Team",
				"One month maximum, determined by the Product Owner based on product complexity",
				"Six weeks maximum, determined by the organization",
				"One month maximum, with the Scrum Team choosing the appropriate length"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 3,
			"explanation": "A Sprint is time-boxed to one month or less. The Scrum Team chooses the appropriate length based on factors like product complexity, risk, and the need for feedback. Shorter Sprints enable faster feedback and adaptation.",

			"question": "A Product Owner wants to attend the Daily Scrum to provide clarifications and answer questions. What should they do?",
			"options": [
				"Attend and participate actively in the Daily Scrum",
				"Attend but only observe without participating",
				"Be available for questions but not attend the Daily Scrum",
				"Schedule a separate meeting with the Development Team"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 2,
			"explanation": "The Daily Scrum is for the Developers. While the Product Owner can be available for questions, they should not attend the Daily Scrum itself. The Developers should reach out if they need clarification.",

			"id": 62,
			"topic": "scrum-events",
			"difficulty": "medium",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "During Sprint Planning, the Development Team says they cannot commit to all the Product Backlog items the Product Owner wants. The Product Owner insists these items are critical. What should happen?",
			"options": [
				"The Product Owner should add the items anyway since they have authority",
				"The Development Team should work overtime to fit all items",
				"The Product Owner and Development Team should negotiate scope to achieve the Sprint Goal",
				"The Sprint length should be extended to accommodate all items"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 2,
			"explanation": "Sprint Planning is collaborative. The Product Owner explains what they want, and the Development Team determines what they can commit to. They should negotiate together to find a solution that achieves the Sprint Goal within the team's capacity.",

			"topic": "scrum-events",
			"difficulty": "medium",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner notices that Sprint Planning consistently takes longer than the time-box. The Development Team says they need more time to understand requirements. What should the Product Owner do?",
			"options": [
				"Extend the Sprint Planning time-box",
				"Provide more detailed requirements documentation before Sprint Planning",
				"Improve Product Backlog refinement to ensure items are better understood",
				"Reduce the number of items discussed in Sprint Planning"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 2,
			"explanation": "Long Sprint Planning sessions often indicate insufficient refinement. The Product Owner should improve ongoing Product Backlog refinement to ensure items are well-understood before Sprint Planning, making the planning session more efficient.",

			"topic": "scrum-events",
			"difficulty": "medium",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "During Sprint Planning, the Product Owner proposes a Sprint Goal, but the Development Team suggests a different Sprint Goal that better aligns with the selected Product Backlog items. What should the Product Owner do?",
			"options": [
				"Insist on the original Sprint Goal as the Product Owner has authority",
				"Collaborate with the Development Team to create a mutually agreed Sprint Goal",
				"Let the Development Team decide the Sprint Goal",
				"Escalate to the Scrum Master for decision"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "Sprint Goal creation is collaborative. The Product Owner should work with the Development Team to create a Sprint Goal that provides value and is achievable with the selected Product Backlog items. Collaboration leads to better commitment and outcomes.",

			"topic": "scrum-events",
			"difficulty": "medium",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner is frustrated because stakeholders skip Sprint Reviews, then complain they don't know what the team is working on. What should the Product Owner do?",
			"options": [
				"Make Sprint Review attendance mandatory for all stakeholders",
				"Create separate demo sessions for different stakeholder groups",
				"Work with stakeholders to understand barriers to attendance and address them",
				"Provide written summaries instead of holding Sprint Reviews"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 2,
			"explanation": "The Product Owner should understand why stakeholders aren't attending and address those barriers. This might involve scheduling, format changes, or better communication about the value of Sprint Reviews. Engagement is more effective than mandates.",

			"type": "single",
			"question": "During a Sprint Review, stakeholders provide conflicting feedback about the Increment. Some love it, others want significant changes. How should the Product Owner handle this?",
			"options": [
				"Prioritize feedback from the most senior stakeholders",
				"Try to accommodate all feedback equally",
				"Evaluate feedback against the product vision and make informed decisions",
				"Schedule separate meetings with each stakeholder group"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 2,
			"explanation": "The Product Owner should evaluate all feedback against the product vision and overall value delivery. Not all feedback is equally valuable. The Product Owner must make informed decisions about what changes would actually improve the product.",

			"topic": "scrum-events",
			"difficulty": "hard",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner wants to use the Sprint Review to present a detailed roadmap and get stakeholder approval for the next quarter's priorities. What is problematic about this approach?",
			"options": [
				"Sprint Reviews should only focus on the current Sprint's work",
				"It turns the Sprint Review into a status meeting rather than an inspection and adaptation opportunity",
				"Stakeholders shouldn't be involved in roadmap discussions",
				"The Development Team should present the roadmap, not the Product Owner"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "The Sprint Review should focus on inspecting the Increment and adapting the Product Backlog based on feedback. Using it for roadmap approval turns it into a status meeting rather than an opportunity for meaningful inspection and adaptation.",

				"Attend the Sprint Retrospective to guide the discussion",
				"Discuss with the Scrum Master about including more product-focused topics",
				"Create a separate retrospective focused on product topics",
				"Accept that technical issues are the Development Team's priority"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "The Product Owner should discuss with the Scrum Master about ensuring the retrospective addresses the full range of improvement opportunities, including collaboration with the Product Owner and product-related processes. The retrospective should improve the whole team's effectiveness.",

			"topic": "scrum-events",
			"difficulty": "hard",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "During a Sprint Review, the Product Owner realizes that the Increment doesn't actually solve the user problem they thought it would. Stakeholders are also confused about the value. What should the Product Owner do?",
			"options": [
				"Present the Increment positively and address concerns later",
				"Acknowledge the issue and collaborate on understanding what would provide value",
				"Blame the Development Team for not building what was requested",
				"Skip the Sprint Review and fix the issues first"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "The Product Owner should acknowledge the issue and use it as a learning opportunity. The Sprint Review is designed for inspection and adaptation - this is exactly the kind of learning moment that should drive Product Backlog changes.",

		{
			"id": 70,
			"topic": "scrum-events",
			"difficulty": "medium",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner wants to add a new urgent item to the current Sprint based on customer escalation. The Development Team says adding it would jeopardize the Sprint Goal. What should happen?",
			"options": [
				"Add the item since customer escalations are always priority",
				"Wait until the next Sprint to add the item",
				"The Product Owner and Development Team should assess if the Sprint Goal can be preserved",
				"Cancel the current Sprint and start over with the new item"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 2,
			"explanation": "The Product Owner and Development Team should collaborate to assess whether the urgent item can be added while preserving the Sprint Goal. If not, they need to decide whether to continue with the current Sprint or cancel it.",

		{
			"id": 71,
			"topic": "scrum-events",
			"difficulty": "medium",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner attends the Sprint Retrospective and dominates the discussion, providing solutions for all identified problems. What is the issue with this approach?",
			"options": [
				"Product Owners shouldn't attend Sprint Retrospectives",
				"It reduces team ownership and self-organization in problem-solving",
				"The Product Owner should only listen, not provide solutions",
				"The Scrum Master should prevent the Product Owner from attending"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "While Product Owners can attend Sprint Retrospectives, dominating the discussion reduces team ownership and self-organization. The team should identify their own solutions for better buy-in and effectiveness.",

		{
			"id": 72,
			"topic": "scrum-events",
			"difficulty": "medium",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner schedules individual meetings with Development Team members between Sprint events to discuss progress and provide direction. What is problematic about this approach?",
			"options": [
				"Individual meetings are more efficient than group meetings",
				"It undermines team cohesion and the collaborative nature of Scrum",
				"The Development Team should initiate all meetings with the Product Owner",
				"Individual meetings should only happen during Sprint Planning"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "Frequent individual meetings can undermine team cohesion and the collaborative nature of Scrum. The Product Owner should primarily interact with the Development Team as a whole, with individual conversations being the exception for specific clarifications.",

			"topic": "scrum-events",
			"difficulty": "hard",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "During Sprint Planning, the Product Owner describes what they want, but the Development Team says the items are too vague to estimate or commit to. This happens frequently. What should the Product Owner address?",
			"options": [
				"The Development Team's estimation skills need improvement",
				"Sprint Planning should be longer to allow for more discussion",
				"Product Backlog refinement is not happening effectively",
				"The Product Owner should provide more detailed specifications"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 2,
			"explanation": "Frequently encountering vague items in Sprint Planning indicates ineffective Product Backlog refinement. The Product Owner should ensure ongoing refinement activities happen throughout the Sprint to prepare items for Sprint Planning.",

		{
			"id": 74,
			"topic": "scrum-events",
			"difficulty": "hard",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner discovers that the Sprint Review has become a formal presentation to executives where the Development Team demonstrates features but there's no real feedback or collaboration. What should the Product Owner do?",
			"options": [
				"Continue the current format since executives are important stakeholders",
				"Transform the Sprint Review into a collaborative working session focused on feedback",
				"Create separate presentations for executives and working sessions for other stakeholders",
				"Eliminate the Sprint Review and provide written updates instead"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "The Sprint Review should be a collaborative working session focused on inspection and adaptation, not a formal presentation. The Product Owner should transform it to encourage real feedback and collaboration with all stakeholders.",

			"difficulty": "hard",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner wants to cancel a Sprint because they realized the Sprint Goal no longer aligns with changing market priorities. The Development Team is upset because they're close to completing the work. What should the Product Owner consider?",
			"options": [
				"Always complete the Sprint once started to avoid disrupting the team",
				"Cancel immediately since the Sprint Goal is obsolete",
				"Weigh the cost of continuing work that won't deliver value against team disruption",
				"Let the Development Team decide whether to continue or cancel"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 2,
			"explanation": "The Product Owner should weigh the cost of continuing work that won't deliver value against the disruption of canceling. If the Sprint Goal is truly obsolete and continuing would waste resources, cancellation may be justified despite team concerns.",

			"topic": "scrum-events",
			"difficulty": "hard",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "During Sprint Review, stakeholders provide feedback that contradicts the Product Owner's product vision. The feedback would improve short-term metrics but harm long-term product strategy. What should the Product Owner do?",
			"options": [
				"Accept all stakeholder feedback to maintain relationships",
				"Ignore feedback that contradicts the product vision",
				"Explain the product vision and facilitate discussion about long-term vs. short-term value",
				"Implement the feedback but document the concerns"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 2,
			"explanation": "The Product Owner should use this as a teaching moment about the product vision and facilitate discussion about long-term vs. short-term value. This helps stakeholders understand the strategic thinking behind product decisions.",

			"question": "A Product Owner realizes during Sprint Planning that they haven't properly refined the highest priority items. The Development Team cannot make commitments without more clarity. What should the Product Owner do?",
			"options": [
				"Extend Sprint Planning to do refinement on the spot",
				"Cancel Sprint Planning and reschedule after proper refinement",
				"Work with available refined items and add others later in the Sprint",
				"Ask the Development Team to estimate based on their best understanding"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 2,
			"explanation": "The Product Owner should work with the items that are properly refined and focus on those for Sprint Planning. Additional items can be added later if they become refined during the Sprint, but Sprint Planning should proceed with available clarity.",

			"question": "During Sprint Review, a Product Owner presents an Increment that technically works but doesn't meet the Definition of Done due to missing documentation. Stakeholders are excited about the functionality. What should happen?",
			"options": [
				"Present the Increment and note that documentation will be completed later",
				"Don't present the Increment since it doesn't meet the Definition of Done",
				"Present the functionality but emphasize it cannot be released yet",
				"Update the Definition of Done to exclude documentation for this Sprint"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "If the Increment doesn't meet the Definition of Done, it shouldn't be presented as 'Done' work. The work should be returned to the Product Backlog. The Definition of Done ensures quality and transparency about what is truly complete.",
