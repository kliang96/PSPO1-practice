			"question": "A Product Owner is told by management that the Scrum Team is 'too small' with only 6 people and should be expanded to 15 people. What should the Product Owner consider?",
			"options": [
				"Agree to expand the team since larger teams can deliver more",
				"Explain that Scrum Teams should be 10 or fewer people for optimal effectiveness",
				"Suggest splitting into two separate teams if more capacity is needed",
				"Both B and C"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 3,
			"explanation": "Scrum Teams should be 10 or fewer people for optimal communication and productivity. If more capacity is needed, the Product Owner should consider splitting into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams rather than creating one large team.",

				"Work with the team to develop the needed skills or adjust the approach",
				"Assign the work to a different team with the required skills"

			"options": [
				"Insist that the team stop focusing on technical work and deliver features faster",
				"Collaborate with the team to balance technical quality with feature delivery",
				"Escalate to management to force the team to prioritize features",
				"Find a different Development Team that focuses on business value"

				"Participating actively in Product Backlog refinement sessions",
				"Providing detailed written specifications to minimize the need for conversation"
			],
			"correctAnswer": [0, 2],
