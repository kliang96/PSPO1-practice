			"options": [
				"Product Backlog (requirements), Sprint Backlog (tasks), Increment (deliverable)",
				"Product Backlog (transparency of work), Sprint Backlog (transparency of Sprint), Increment (transparency of progress)",
				"Product Vision (direction), Sprint Plan (execution), Product Release (delivery)",
				"Requirements Document (scope), Work Breakdown (tasks), Deliverable (output)"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "The three Scrum artifacts are Product Backlog (transparency of work to be done), Sprint Backlog (transparency of work planned for the Sprint), and Increment (transparency of work completed and progress toward Product Goal).",

			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner notices that Sprint Backlogs consistently include work that wasn't in the original Sprint Planning. The Development Team says they're 'discovering necessary tasks.' What should the Product Owner investigate?",
			"options": [
				"Whether the Development Team is properly skilled for the work",
				"Whether Product Backlog items are sufficiently refined before Sprint Planning",
				"Whether the Sprint length needs to be increased",
				"Whether the Scrum Master is providing adequate guidance"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "Consistently discovering unplanned work suggests Product Backlog items aren't sufficiently refined. The Product Owner should investigate whether items are properly understood and detailed before Sprint Planning to reduce surprises.",

			"question": "A Product Owner wants to release functionality mid-Sprint that the Development Team says is 'working but not done.' The feature passes user acceptance testing but doesn't meet some Definition of Done criteria. What should the Product Owner do?",
			"options": [
				"Release the functionality since it meets user needs",
				"Wait until the work meets the full Definition of Done",
				"Create a separate Definition of Done for urgent releases",
				"Release with documented technical debt to address later"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "The Definition of Done cannot be compromised. It ensures quality and sustainable development. The Product Owner should wait until work truly meets the Definition of Done before releasing, even if it delays the release.",

			"difficulty": "medium",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner's stakeholders complain that they can't understand product progress from Sprint Reviews. They want detailed documentation of what was accomplished. How should the Product Owner respond?",
			"options": [
				"Create comprehensive documentation after each Sprint",
				"Improve the Sprint Review to better demonstrate the working Increment",
				"Ask the Development Team to provide detailed progress reports",
				"Schedule separate stakeholder briefings with documentation"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "The Increment itself should provide transparency about progress. The Product Owner should improve Sprint Reviews to better demonstrate working functionality rather than relying on documentation, which provides less valuable transparency.",

				"Items are valuable to users or stakeholders",
				"Items include detailed technical implementation plans",
				"Items are small enough to be completed within a Sprint",
				"Items are testable and have clear acceptance criteria"
			],
			"correctAnswer": [0, 2, 3],
			"explanation": "Good Product Backlog items should be valuable, appropriately sized for Sprint completion, and testable with clear acceptance criteria. Technical implementation details should emerge through collaboration, not be specified upfront.",

			"question": "A Product Owner notices that Increments are created throughout the Sprint, but stakeholders only see progress during Sprint Reviews. How can the Product Owner improve transparency?",
			"options": [
				"Require stakeholders to attend daily check-ins",
				"Create detailed progress reports between Sprint Reviews",
				"Make Increments visible to stakeholders as they're completed",
				"Wait until Sprint Reviews to show any progress"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 2,
			"explanation": "Transparency is improved by making Increments visible as they're completed, not just at Sprint Reviews. This provides stakeholders with real-time visibility into progress and enables faster feedback.",

			"question": "A Product Owner faces pressure to release an Increment with known security vulnerabilities because 'customers are waiting.' The vulnerabilities don't meet the Definition of Done, but marketing says the delay will cost sales. What should the Product Owner do?",
			"options": [
				"Release with vulnerabilities and fix them in the next release",
				"Negotiate a partial release of features that meet the Definition of Done",
				"Maintain the Definition of Done and work with the team to address security issues",
				"Create a temporary exception to the Definition of Done for this release"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 2,
			"explanation": "The Definition of Done ensures quality and cannot be compromised, especially for security issues. The Product Owner should maintain standards and work with the team to address issues, protecting long-term value over short-term gains.",

		{
			"id": 50,
			"topic": "scrum-artifacts",
			"difficulty": "medium",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "Stakeholders ask the Product Owner for a traditional project plan with delivery dates for all Product Backlog items. How should the Product Owner provide transparency while managing expectations?",
			"options": [
				"Create fixed delivery dates for all Product Backlog items",
				"Provide a prioritized view of the Product Backlog with expected sequencing but explain the empirical nature of delivery",
				"Refuse to provide any timeline information",
				"Ask the Development Team to commit to specific delivery dates"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "The Product Owner should provide transparency about priorities and likely sequencing while educating stakeholders about empirical development. Fixed dates create false certainty that contradicts Scrum's empirical approach.",

		},
		{
			"id": 52,
			"topic": "scrum-artifacts",
			"difficulty": "hard",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner consistently brings large, unrefined items to Sprint Planning, causing long planning sessions and incomplete Sprint Backlogs. The team is frustrated. What is the core issue the Product Owner must address?",
			"options": [
				"The Sprint Planning timebox is too short for complex items",
				"The Development Team lacks estimation skills for large items",
				"Product Backlog refinement is not happening effectively between Sprints",
				"The Product Owner needs to provide more detailed specifications"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 2,
			"explanation": "The core issue is ineffective Product Backlog refinement. The Product Owner should ensure items are properly refined before Sprint Planning, breaking down large items and clarifying requirements through ongoing refinement activities.",

		},
		{
			"id": 53,
			"topic": "scrum-artifacts",
			"difficulty": "medium",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner wants to measure team productivity by counting completed Product Backlog items per Sprint. What are the problems with this approach?",
			"options": [
				"Different items have different complexity and value",
				"It focuses on output rather than outcomes and value delivery",
				"It may encourage gaming the system by splitting or combining items artificially",
				"All of the above"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 3,
			"explanation": "All these issues apply. Counting items ignores complexity differences, focuses on output over value, and may encourage gaming. Product Owners should focus on value delivery and customer outcomes rather than item counts.",

			"question": "A Product Owner discovers that the Development Team has been adding technical debt items to Sprint Backlogs without discussion. What should the Product Owner do to improve transparency and decision-making?",
			"options": [
				"Forbid the team from working on technical debt",
				"Add technical debt items to the Product Backlog for proper prioritization",
				"Allow the team to continue managing technical debt independently",
				"Create separate technical debt Sprints"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "Technical debt items should be visible in the Product Backlog and prioritized by the Product Owner. This ensures transparency and allows informed decisions about balancing technical work with new features.",

			"question": "A Product Owner is preparing for a Sprint Review where they'll demonstrate the Increment. Which statements about the Increment are true? (Choose all that apply)",
			"options": [
				"It must be in usable condition even if the Product Owner chooses not to release it",
				"It includes all work completed in the current Sprint plus all previous Increments",
				"It can only be demonstrated at the end of the Sprint",
				"It must meet the Definition of Done to be considered complete"
			],
			"correctAnswer": [0, 1, 3],
			"explanation": "The Increment must be usable, includes all previous work, and must meet the Definition of Done. However, Increments can be created and potentially demonstrated multiple times during a Sprint, not just at the end.",

			"difficulty": "hard",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "The organization's Definition of Done includes 'deployed to production,' but there's a separate business approval process before features can be released to customers. How should the Product Owner handle this conflict?",
			"options": [
				"Remove deployment from the Definition of Done",
				"Include business approval in the Definition of Done",
				"Deploy to production but keep features disabled until approved",
				"Work with the organization to align the Definition of Done with actual release capability"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 3,
			"explanation": "The Product Owner should work to align the Definition of Done with actual release capability. The Definition should represent work that could realistically be released, considering all organizational constraints.",

			"question": "Senior management pressures a Product Owner to release an Increment with known quality issues, saying 'we can fix problems later.' The issues violate the Definition of Done. What should the Product Owner do?",
			"options": [
				"Release the Increment to maintain management support",
				"Refuse to release and explain the long-term consequences of compromising quality",
				"Release but clearly document all known issues and risks",
				"Temporarily lower the Definition of Done for this release"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "The Product Owner should refuse to compromise the Definition of Done and explain the long-term consequences. Quality debt compounds over time and undermines future value delivery. Maintaining standards protects long-term product success.",

			"topic": "scrum-artifacts",
			"difficulty": "hard",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner is managing a complex product with multiple stakeholder groups. They're considering creating separate Product Backlogs for each group to manage demands. What is the primary risk of this approach?",
			"options": [
				"It increases the Product Owner's workload significantly",
				"It fragments the product vision and makes value optimization difficult",
				"It violates Scrum rules about having one Product Backlog",
				"It reduces stakeholder transparency into each other's requirements"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "The primary risk is fragmenting the product vision and making it difficult to optimize overall value. The Product Owner needs a single view of all work to make effective trade-off decisions that maximize value for the entire product.",

			"topic": "scrum-artifacts",
			"difficulty": "medium",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner has been creating detailed specifications, mockups, and test cases for Product Backlog items before refinement. The Development Team says this reduces their engagement and creativity. What should the Product Owner do?",
			"options": [
				"Continue with detailed specifications to ensure quality and reduce ambiguity",
				"Create lighter initial specifications and encourage collaborative refinement",
				"Eliminate all upfront specifications and rely entirely on conversation",
				"Ask the Development Team to create their own detailed specifications"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "The Product Owner should balance initial clarity with collaborative engagement. Over-specification reduces team creativity and buy-in, while under-specification creates confusion. Collaborative refinement often produces better solutions.",
