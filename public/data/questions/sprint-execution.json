			"topic": "sprint-execution",
			"difficulty": "medium",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner discovers that incomplete work from the current Sprint includes a partially implemented feature that stakeholders really want. What should they do with this work?",
			"options": [
				"Automatically add it to the next Sprint since it's partially done",
				"Return it to the Product Backlog and reprioritize it based on current value",
				"Extend the current Sprint to complete the feature",
				"Ask the Development Team to finish it outside of Sprint time"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "Incomplete work should be returned to the Product Backlog and reprioritized based on current value. The Product Owner shouldn't assume previous priority still applies and should make fresh prioritization decisions.",

			"topic": "sprint-execution",
			"difficulty": "medium",
			"type": "single",
			"question": "A Product Owner proposes a Sprint Goal that focuses on 'completing as many Product Backlog items as possible.' What's problematic about this Sprint Goal?",
			"options": [
				"It doesn't specify exact deliverables",
				"It lacks focus and doesn't provide clear direction or value",
				"It's too ambitious for the Development Team",
				"It doesn't include specific acceptance criteria"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "A good Sprint Goal should provide focus and clear direction toward a specific objective. 'Completing as many items as possible' lacks focus and doesn't help the team understand what value they're trying to deliver.",

				"Collaborate with the team to potentially adjust scope while preserving the Sprint Goal intent",
				"Cancel the Sprint immediately since the Sprint Goal can't be met",
				"Accept whatever the team can deliver and set a new Sprint Goal"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "The Product Owner should collaborate with the team to find ways to preserve the Sprint Goal's intent while adjusting scope. The Sprint Goal should drive value-focused trade-offs rather than just accepting whatever gets done.",
