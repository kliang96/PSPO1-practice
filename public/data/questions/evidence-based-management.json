			"options": [
				"Always review monthly to maintain consistency across all products",
				"Review quarterly to align with business reporting cycles",
				"Adjust frequency based on the measure's volatility and decision-making needs",
				"Review only when stakeholders request updated metrics"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 2,
			"explanation": "EBM review frequency should be contextual - measures that change rapidly or are critical for immediate decisions need more frequent review, while stable measures can be reviewed less frequently. The frequency should support timely decision-making.",

			"question": "A Product Owner's EBM measurements show that feature adoption rates are 30% lower than expected, but customer satisfaction remains high. What does this paradox suggest?",
			"options": [
				"The measurements are inaccurate and should be recalibrated",
				"Customers are satisfied with core functionality and don't need additional features",
				"The Time-to-Market is too slow, preventing proper feature adoption",
				"The Ability to Innovate is too high, creating unnecessary complexity"
			],
			"correctAnswer": 1,
			"explanation": "High satisfaction with low feature adoption suggests customers are satisfied with core functionality. This indicates the product may be over-engineered or that new features don't address real customer needs. The Product Owner should focus on core value rather than feature quantity.",
